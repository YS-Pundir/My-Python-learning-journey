#  Python Learning Journey

This repository contains the **original Python practice files** from the beginning of my programming journey.  
These scripts and exercises represent my honest early learning — loops, functions, OOP, file handling, and more.

---

##  What This Repository Contains ->

- Basic Python syntax  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops  
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- Functions and practice problems  
- File I/O  
- Modules  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation  
- Jupyter notebook practice  
- Small exercises and experiments  

These files are kept **raw** intentionally — to preserve my real journey exactly as it was.

---

##  Why I Uploaded This ->

I want my GitHub to show my:

- Growth from beginner to advanced  
- Consistent learning  
- Real effort and practice  
- Foundation before entering bigger projects  
- Story as a Software Engineering student  

This repository is the **first chapter** of my coding story.

##  What’s Next ->

I will now continue with:

- **Python Revision** (clean, structured, advanced)  
- **Java Revision**  
- **Backend Development (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)**  
- **DSA practice**  
- **Agentic AI Systems (IIT Roorkee)**  

You will find all progress in my upcoming repositories.

##  Timeline->

- **Started Learning Python:** 01 september,2025 
- **Uploaded to GitHub:** 16 november ,2025  
- **Continuing:** Revision + Projects +  Agentic AI learning  + AI learning
