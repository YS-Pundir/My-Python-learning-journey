Instructions
Task Overview 
Create a Python program that uses a class to manage and process a set of integers. The class should contain five variables, several functions to perform mathematical operations, and a display method to show all computed results. In addition to the class, you must write separate code that collects user input. 
 
Tasks
Create a class named NumberProcessor that includes the following: 


Attributes (Variables): 
1.	A list to hold the integers 
2.	A variable to store the total sum 
3.	A variable to store the average 
4.	A variable to store the largest value 
5.	A variable to store the smallest value 
Methods: 
•	compute_sum(numbers): Returns the total sum of the numbers 
•	compute_average(numbers): Returns the average value 
•	find_largest(numbers): Returns the largest number 
•	find_smallest(numbers): Returns the smallest number 
•	display(): Calls all the above methods and print the sum, the average , the largest number , the smallest number 
User Input Requirements 
•	Outside the class, write code to: 
•	Prompt the user to input five integers 
•	Store these integers in a list 
•	Pass the list to an instance of the class
